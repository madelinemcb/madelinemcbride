  Welcome to my (github) world. I'm Madeline, an ameteur cartography and GIS scientist. Currently hunkered down in Virginia/Washington, DC <br><br>
I work for a civil rights organization! It's great! They let me make all maps and I get to choose all the colors :)
 <br><br>
In this amateur portfolio you'll see some things I'm passionate about - mostly social issues, design and a little bit fun. I like to make my maps/graphics a little silly, when I can get away with it. My maps are positive, ethical and honest. 
All the maps and visuals here are of my own creation. 
 <br><br>
Thanks for visiting this page! Peace.
